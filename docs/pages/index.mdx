## The best way to connect an ICP wallet

[NFID IdentityKit](https://identitykit.xyz) is a React library that makes it easy to add 
wallet connection to your dapp. It's intuitive, responsive and customizable. 
Developers will be able to easily select which wallets they want to support 
in their apps for authentication, signatures, and transfers.

## Features

### Wallet management

Out-of-the-box wallet management for your dapp. Aside from handling the connection and disconnection of wallets,
IdentityKit supports numerous wallets, allows dapps to request wallet signatures and canister calls, and
abstracts all the complexity behind an easy-to-use SDK.

### Customizable

You can tweak IdentityKit UI to match your style. You can pick from two display modes - Featured and Compact - 
three color modes - light, dark, and system - and choose the order or display of the wallets you want to support.

### Industry standard

The NFID team worked with the community and DFINITY to create the standards apps need to interact with users:
- ICRC-25 to get permissions and the wallet's supported standards
- ICRC-27 to get wallet addresses
- ICRC-49 to ask those wallet addresses to execute authenticated canister calls
- ICRC-34 to get a key (either a key for the wallet address that can make authenticated calls to your canisters, or one to make authenticated calls to any canister)

We've packaged those up into IdentityKit to make working with them easy for developers.

ICP wallets that plan to conform to ICRC standards and add themselves to IdentityKit:

- NFID Wallet
- Internet Identity
- Plug Wallet
- Oisy Wallet

We do not plan to offer standalone support for NFID Wallet integration. Use IdentityKit and whitelist only NFID Wallet
if that's the only wallet you want to support, though we do not recommend excluding wallets 
unless you know they do not support the standards you need.

Get started with [installation](/getting-started/installation).
