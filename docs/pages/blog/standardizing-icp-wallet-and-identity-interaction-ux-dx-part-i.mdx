# Standardizing ICP Wallet and Identity Interaction UX & DX - Part I

The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) has emerged as a pivotal force in the realm of decentralized
applications, with its rapid evolution and diverse applications ranging from Bitcoin marketplaces to
music streaming platforms. This dynamic growth has reshaped the way we interact with decentralized
systems, significantly reducing reliance on centralized infrastructure and leveraging the inherent
security of the protocol itself. However, the journey has not been without its challenges.

## What is this post about?

Developers building on the Internet Computer have encountered significant challenges in
accommodating the wide range of wallet and identity options available (i.e. NFID, Internet Identity,
Plug, Stoic, Me, etc). This difficulty primarily arises from the need to adapt to each wallet's
unique interfaces for user authentication, token transfers, and other identity-related interactions,
leading to compatibility issues and delays in development.

This post aims to update on the development of standards designed to resolve these challenges. The
goal is to create a unified standard package that developers can implement to support all existing
and future ICP wallet and identity providers seamlessly.

These standards are currently under development, and we encourage the ICP community to actively
participate in finalizing them. The development process has been transparent and collaborative
within the Identity and Wallet Standard Working Group, which meets publicly every two weeks and
primarily the work of @IdentityMaxis (NFID Team) and DFINITY.

With DFINITY's support, the NFID team is releasing the @nfid/identity-kit package as an open-source
tool designed to simplify the integration of these new standards. This package will enable
developers to effortlessly incorporate a broad spectrum of functionalities, paving the way for a
more interconnected and efficient application environment.

Post-implementation of these standards, the most noticeable change for users will be the increased
compatibility between applications and a variety of wallets. This means users can manage assets more
efficiently and engage with applications in more dynamic ways. Features like secure data sharing
across applications without compromising privacy will become a norm.

### ICRC-25 Base Signer Interaction Standard

This standard outlines a foundational protocol for communication between decentralized apps (dapps)
and signers (wallets and identity providers that can generate signatures). It specifies a set of
messages to facilitate this interaction, ensuring a seamless and secure exchange of information.
ICRC-25 aims to create a uniform language for dapps and signers, enhancing interoperability and
simplifying the development process.

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### What's next

In part 2 of this developer series, we'll share the prototype UX for how this will look in your
dapps, and the configuration options we'll provide at launch.

In part 3, we'll share a beta example for you to explore, tweak, and test.
