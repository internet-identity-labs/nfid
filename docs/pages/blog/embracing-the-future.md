# Streamlining Development: Embracing ICP Wallet Standards in Web3

The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) has emerged as a pivotal force in the realm of decentralized applications, with its rapid evolution and diverse applications ranging from Bitcoin marketplaces to music streaming platforms. This dynamic growth has reshaped the way we interact with decentralized systems, significantly reducing reliance on centralized infrastructures and leveraging the inherent security of the protocol itself. However, the journey is not without its challenges.

## Why ICP Wallet Standards are Important

### Empowering User Choice in Web3

In the ever-evolving landscape of Web3, one principle stands paramount: user choice. This ethos not only advocates for freedom in wallet selection but also demands flexibility in interaction with various applications. The current state of ICP application development, however, presents a significant hurdle. The need for individual wallet integrations consumes vast amounts of time and resources, diverting attention from enhancing application functionality. Recognizing this, DFINITY and the NFID Wallet team are spearheading an initiative to standardize cryptographic flows, thereby broadening user choices and smoothing the developer experience.

### Streamlining the Development Process

By introducing standard wallet protocols, developers can bypass the cumbersome process of individual wallet integrations. This standardization not only accelerates the development cycle but also opens the door for a wider range of wallet options for users. The outcome is a more robust and user-friendly ecosystem, where developers can focus on innovation rather than integration.

## How ICP Wallet Standards Will Be Used

### Enhancing User Experience with Seamless Integration

Post-implementation of these standards, the most noticeable change for users will be the increased compatibility between applications and a variety of wallets. This means users can manage assets more efficiently and engage with applications in more dynamic ways. Features like secure data sharing across applications without compromising privacy will become a norm.

### NFID's Role in Facilitating Adoption

The NFID team is poised to release the IdentityKit package, an open-source tool designed to simplify the integration of these new standards. This package will enable developers to effortlessly incorporate a broad spectrum of functionalities, paving the way for a more interconnected and efficient application environment.

## Exploring the Different ICP Wallet Standards

### ICRC-25 Base Signer Interaction Standard

This standard outlines a foundational protocol for communication between decentralized apps (dapps) and signers. It specifies a set of messages to facilitate this interaction, ensuring a seamless and secure exchange of information. The ICRC-25 aims to create a uniform language for dapps and signers, enhancing interoperability and simplifying the development process.

### ICRC-31 Get Principals

The `icrc31_get_principals` message plays a crucial role in identity management. It allows applications to retrieve information about the identities managed by a signer, streamlining the authentication process. This standard is pivotal in ensuring that users can manage their digital identities efficiently and securely.

### ICRC-32 Sign Challenge

The `icrc32_sign_challenge` method provides a secure mechanism for verifying ownership of user identities. By facilitating cryptographic proofs, this standard strengthens the security framework of applications, ensuring that user identities are protected and authenticated reliably.

### ICRC-33 Call Canister

This standard allows applications to request the execution of calls to third-party canisters by the signer. By using the `icrc33_call_canister` method, applications can interact with a broader range of services and functionalities, enhancing the versatility and reach of ICP-based applications.

### ICRC-34 Get Delegation

The `icrc34_get_delegation` method is designed to facilitate the delegation of identity management. This process allows users to securely manage their identities and permissions, providing a flexible and secure framework for identity delegation within the ICP ecosystem.

In conclusion, the introduction of ICP wallet standards is a significant stride towards a more unified and user-friendly Web3 environment. These standards not only alleviate the developmental challenges but also enrich the user experience, paving the way for a more interconnected and secure digital future.
