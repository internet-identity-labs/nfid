## Approving a transaction

Members and admins can navigate into each transaction to see the actions they can take: approve,
reject, or cancel. Only the transaction initiator can cancel a transaction, and only one rejection
is required for a transaction to be rejected.

## Transaction statuses

A transaction can have three statuses:

- **Approved** when the requisite number of members have approved the transaction
- **Rejected** when one member rejected the transaction _or if the wallet doesn't have enough funds_
- **Canceled** when the initiator canceled the transaction
