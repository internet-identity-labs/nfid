## Adding a member

In this current version of NFID Vaults, the person who created the Vault has the one and only Admin
role who is able to add or remove members.

Admins must ask prospective Vault Members for their NFID Vault address, which can be found at the
top of the "Vaults" page in their NFID profiles.

## Renaming a member

Admins don't have a name, so they'll need to rename themselves (or other Members) from the `Edit`
menu available from the three-dot menu to the right of each Member.

## Removing a member

Admins are able to remove Members by archiving them from the three-dot menu to the right of each
Member.
