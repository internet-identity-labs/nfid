## Creating a new NFID Vault

An NFID Vault is like owning your own bank with as many bank accounts as you want, and deciding the
conditions under which transactions can be approved.

Create a new NFID Vault simply by tapping "Add Vault" on desktop or "+" button on mobile to name and
describe the purpose for your vault.

## What's in a Vault?

Vaults consist of four primary objects:

- **Wallets** are the addresses that store your digital assets, like bank accounts
- **Members** are the people you trust to approve transactions from any of the Vault's wallets
- **Policies** are the conditions you set for how transactions are approved
- **Transactions** are the actual outputs that could have three states: pending, approved, or
  rejected

Once you've created an NFID Vault or been included as an approver to one, click on the Vault to see
more information.
