## Creating a new NFID Vault Account

An NFID Vault Account is where digital assets are stored. Their account identifiers can be found by
navigating to `Receive` in the three-dot menu to the right of each wallet.

Create a new NFID Vault Account address by tapping "Add Account" on desktop or "+" button on mobile
and giving it a name.

## Receiving assets to your NFID Vault Account

By navigating to `Receive` in the three-dot menu to the right of each account, you'll see its
"account identifier". You may always reach this screen by tapping the "Send/Receive" button on the
top of your desktop screen or bottom of mobile.

## Sending assets from your NFID Vault Account

By navigating to `Send` in the three-dot menu to the right of each account, you'll have the option
to initiate a transaction. You may always reach this screen by tapping the "Send/Receive" button on
the top of your desktop screen or bottom of mobile.

Transactions are only approved when the requisite number of Vault Members submit their approval.
