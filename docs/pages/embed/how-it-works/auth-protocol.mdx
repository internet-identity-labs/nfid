## Introduction

When a client wants to authenticate a user, it uses a _session key_ (e.g., Ed25519 or ECDSA) and,
through the authentication flow (details below), obtains a
[delegation chain](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#certification-delegation)
that allows the session key to sign for the user's main identity.

There are two types of session keys - one for an external application (_client delegation_) to
manage a scoped set of user permissions, and one for the main client (_NFID delegation_) to give
users full administrative control of their identity.

Non-ICP networks, like EVM, only need a `provider`.

### Client Delegations

The delegation chain consists of one delegation, called the _client delegation_, that delegates from
the user identity to the session key. This delegation is created by the NFID Delegator smart
contract and signed using a
[smart contract (canister) signature](https://hydra.dfinity.systems/latest/dfinity-ci-build/ic-ref.pr-319/interface-spec/1/index.html#canister-signatures).
This delegation is scoped to the client's canisters and has a maximum lifetime of 30 days, with a
default of 30 minutes.

### NFID Delegation

The NFID client also manages an _NFID delegation_, delegating from the passkey's public key to a
session key managed by this frontend, so that it can interact with its smart contracts without
having to invoke the passkey for each signature.

### Non-ICP Networks (i.e., EVM chains)

When non-ICP clients want to authenticate a user, it receives a `provider`, constructed on the
frontend by the _NFID delegation_.

## From the Point of View of a Client ICP Application:

1. The application frontend creates a session key pair (e.g., Ed25519).
2. It installs a `message` event handler on its own `window`.
3. It loads the URL `https://nfid.one/#authorize` in an `iframe`. Let `nfidWindow` be the `Window`
   object returned from this.
4. In the `nfidWindow`, the user logs in, and the `nfidWindow` invokes

   ```javascript
   window.opener.postMessage(msg, "*")
   ```

   where `msg` is

   ```javascript
   interface NFIDReady {
     kind: "authorize-ready";
   }
   ```

5. The client application, after receiving the `NFIDReady` message, invokes

   ```javascript
   nfidWindow.postMessage(msg, "https://nfid.one")
   ```

   where `msg` is a value of type

   ```javascript
   interface NFIDAuthRequest {
     kind: "authorize-client";
     sessionPublicKey: Uint8Array;
     maxTimeToLive?: bigint;
     derivationOrigin?: string;
   }
   ```

   - the `sessionPublicKey` contains the public key of the session key pair.
   - the `maxTimeToLive`, if present, indicates the desired time span (in nanoseconds) until the
     requested delegation should expire.
   - the `derivationOrigin`, if present, indicates an origin that should be used for principal
     derivation instead of the client origin. Values must match the following regular expression:
     `^https:\/\/[\w-]+(\.raw)?\.(ic0\.app|icp0\.io)$`. NFID will only accept values that are also
     listed in the HTTP resource `https://<canister_id>.ic0.app/.well-known/ii-alternative-origins`
     of the corresponding canister (see
     [Alternative Frontend Origins](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ii-spec#alternative-frontend-origins)).

6. Now the client application window expects a message back, with data `event`.
7. If `event.origin` is not `https://nfid.one`, ignore this message.
8. The `event.data` value is a JS object with the following type:

   ```javascript
   interface NFIDAuthResponse {
     kind: "authorize-client-success";
     delegations: [{
       delegation: {
         pubkey: Uint8Array;
         expiration: bigint;
         targets?: Principal[];
       };
       signature: Uint8Array;
     }];
     userPublicKey: Uint8Array;
   }
   ```

   where the `userPublicKey` is the user's Identity and `delegations` corresponds to the
   CBOR-encoded delegation chain as used for
   [authentication on the IC](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#authentication).

9. It could also receive a failure message of the following type

   ```javascript
   interface NFIDAuthResponse {
     kind: "authorize-client-failure";
     text: string;
   }
   ```

   The client application frontend needs to be able to detect when any of the delegations in the
   chain has expired and re-authorize the user in that case.

The [@nfid/embed](../integration/quickstart) is a helpful package for developers to quickly get this
set up.
