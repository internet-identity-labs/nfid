## Authentication

### Check if the user is authenticated

You can hack it with the `nfid.isAuthenticated` property. If `true` the user is already
authenticated and you can request the delegation identity directly without user interaction from
`nfid.getIdentity()`:

```tsx copy
import { Identity } from "@dfinity/agent"

const identity: Identity = nfid.getIdentity()
```

If not, prepare the `Identity` package from `@dfinity/agent` and open the NFID Wallet auth modal
when a user needs to authenticate with `nfid.getDelegation()`:

```tsx copy
import { Identity } from "@dfinity/agent";

const delegationIdentity: Identity = await nfid.getDelegation({
  // optional targets ICRC-28 implementation, but required to support universal NFID Wallet auth
  targets: ["YOUR_CANISTER_ID_1", "YOUR_CANISTER_ID_2", "ETC"],
  // optional derivationOrigin in case you're running on a custom domain
  derivationOrigin, "https://<canister_id>.ic0.app",
  // optional maxTimeToLive defaults to 8 hours in nanoseconds;
  maxTimeToLive: BigInt(8) * BigInt(3_600_000_000_000)
});
```

The [ICRC-28](wallet/#icrc-28-implementation) will describe the method `YOUR_CANISTER_ID_1`,
`YOUR_CANISTER_ID_2`, and `ETC` canisters should have implemented.

> See more detailed information on [using custom domains with the `derivationOrigin`](domain).

### Check if delegation is universal or anonymous

When a user authenticates, you can use `nfid.getDelegationType()` to see if the authenticated wallet
is universal or anonymous.

```tsx copy
enum DelegationType {
  GLOBAL = 0,
  ANONYMOUS = 1,
}

const delegationType: DelegationType = nfid.getDelegationType()
```
