## Types of Data Collected

Among the types of Personal Data that Internet Identity Labs collects, by itself or through third
parties, there is: Usage Data.

Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of
this privacy policy or by specific explanation texts displayed prior to the Data collection.

Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, collected automatically
when using Internet Identity Labs.

Data requested by Internet Identity Labs is not mandatory and failure to provide this Data does not
make it impossible for Internet Identity Labs to provide its services. Users are free not to
communicate this Data without consequences to the availability or the functioning of the Service.

Private data related to the account, such as an email address will be collected by Internet Identity
Labs, as it is mandatory to the use of service. In particular, enabling 2FA with passkeys require a
memorable username and will be the account's email address for clearly understanding which account
is being authenticated.

Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.

Any use of other tracking tools by Internet Identity Labs or by the owners of third-party services
used by Internet Identity Labs serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in
addition to any other purposes described in the present document.

Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through
Internet Identity Labs and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to
the Owner.

## Mode and Place of Processing the Data

### Methods of Processing

The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data. The Data processing is carried out using
computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to
the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to
certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of Internet Identity Labs
(administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as
third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies,
communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list
of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.

### Legal Basis of Processing

The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:

- Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations
  the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing
  (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This,
  however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data
  protection law;
- provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
  pre-contractual obligations thereof;
- processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
- processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
  official authority vested in the Owner;
- processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a
  third party.

In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

### Place

The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties
involved in the processing are located. Where anonymized Data is processed by Posthog, it never
leaves their GDPR-compliant EU servers.

Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a
country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.

Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the
European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up
by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to
safeguard their Data.

If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this
document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.

### Retention Time

Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been
collected for.

Therefore:

- Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner
  and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
- Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as
  long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
  legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by
  contacting the Owner.

The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be
obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance
of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.

Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access,
the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be
enforced after expiration of the retention period.
