# `@nfid/postmessage-rpc`

The @nfid/postmessage-rpc package is a library that provides a convenient way to implement RPC
(Remote Procedure Call) communication using the postMessage API in JavaScript. It allows you to
establish a bidirectional communication channel between different windows or iframes in a web
application. This package simplifies the process of sending and receiving messages, making it easier
to build distributed systems or integrate different parts of a web application.
